#.	Code chunk to create a subset of countries

# Assuming 'data' is your original data frame from the CSV file
# Create a new dataset named 'filtered'

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Using the summary() function
summary(filtered)


```
```{r echo=FALSE}
#	Write inline code 
```

We have data about `r nrow(data)` countries. Only `r nrow(data) - nrow(filtered)`  have a population share of greater than 1.0. The distribution of this is shown below: 

## Including Plots


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
